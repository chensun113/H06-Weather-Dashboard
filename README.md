This is the assignment for week6. The Weather Dashboard
I have completed most commands but not css part.
To start this assignment, the first thing is getting virables from jquery. Then, start to create two functions which get names data and numbers data from open.weather website. use .appendChild add data to particular parts. The important thing is transforming to the correct units. Such as in the website,tempreture use "kf",and our website need to show "F'. What's more, the date on source website is 1970 1st of Jan. The local time also needs to change from defult UTC on website to EST in moment(date).js.
  The forcast calsuate: every 3 hours changed when the i plus 1 in the loop. we need 5 days.
Then. setting the history function to get city name first and use it in the function save() and show(); I think the most struggling part is setting storage and get them.
  After setting and getting status,the last thing is addEventListener by clicking.
